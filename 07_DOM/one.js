// in js ".innerHTML" is used for element manipulation and ".getElementById" is used for accessing element
// .querySelector always returns first appearance of the id/class
//nodelist is different from array which doesn't have map() property
//while using querySelectorAll it always returns a nodelist, so to access it we need to use index of the element we need to access.
// getElementById returns HTML collection whereas queryselectorAll returns nodelist
